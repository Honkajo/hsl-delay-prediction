# hsl-delay-prediction

Data we use for the training model:

-transit coordinates

-station coordinates

-real-time data about the times transit comes to the station

-timetable data about the times transit should come to the station



#so now that we have a script that calculates the current delay of the vehicle to the next stop how do we train a model to predict the additional delay that will be added before it actually reaches its stop. So if the bus is 2km away from the stop and its already 5 minutes late, how can we predict how much delay it will have once it drives the 2km and actually ends up at the stop

#Ah! Now we’re talking about the **core predictive ML problem**: given a vehicle’s **current state**, predict **additional delay it will accumulate before reaching the next stop**. Let’s carefully break this down.

---

## 1️⃣ Define the problem clearly

**Input (features) at a given moment / location):**

* `distance_to_next_stop` (meters) → how far is the vehicle from the stop
* `current_delay` (seconds) → how late the vehicle is **right now**
* `speed` / estimated average speed over last segment (optional)
* `route_id` / `trip_id` (categorical) → accounts for route characteristics
* `stop_sequence` → which stop it is approaching
* `time_of_day`, `day_of_week` → captures traffic patterns
* `historical avg travel times` (optional) → previous runs on this route/segment

**Output (target variable):**

* `additional_delay` = delay accumulated **from now until arrival at the stop**

Example:

| current_delay | distance_to_stop | time_of_day | target (additional_delay) |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 300 s         | 2000 m           | 08:15       | 180 s                     |

* `current_delay = 5 min`
* `distance_to_stop = 2 km`
* After driving 2 km, the vehicle arrives **3 minutes later than it would have based on its current 5-min delay**, so `additional_delay = 180 s`.

---

## 2️⃣ How to generate training data

Since your ML model predicts **additional delay**, you need **historical trips with GPS + timetable**:

1. **Collect historical GPS traces per trip**.
2. **Map each GPS point to the nearest stop** (like your current script).
3. For each GPS point:

   * Compute **current delay** at that moment.
   * Compute **future delay** at the stop (`scheduled_arrival - actual_arrival`).
   * Calculate **additional delay = future delay − current delay**

This will give you a dataset of `(features now) → (additional_delay)`.

## 3️⃣ Feature engineering

Some practical features to include:

1. **Distance-related**

   * Distance to next stop
   * Remaining travel distance along route

2. **Time-related**

   * Current delay
   * Time of day, day of week
   * Elapsed time on trip

3. **Route / vehicle**

   * Route ID, stop sequence
   * Vehicle type, if available
   * Historical average speed / delay on this segment

4. **Optional environmental**

   * Weather
   * Traffic / congestion info

---

## 4️⃣ Model choices

* **Regression models**: predict additional delay in seconds

  * Linear Regression (baseline)
  * Random Forest / Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM) → often best for tabular features
  * Neural Networks → if using sequential GPS points

* **Optional classification**:

  * Predict “additional delay bucket” (e.g., 0–1 min, 1–2 min, etc.)

---

## 5️⃣ Example workflow

1. For a historical trip:

   * Map GPS points along the route
   * Compute `current_delay` at each point
   * Compute `additional_delay = final_delay_at_stop - current_delay`
   * Record features + target

2. Train regression model:

   ```python
   X = [current_delay, distance_to_stop, time_of_day, stop_sequence, route_id, ...]
   y = additional_delay
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

3. Prediction in real time:

   * Input: current vehicle state (GPS, distance, current delay, time, etc.)
   * Output: predicted additional delay → add to `current_delay` to estimate **expected delay at arrival**

---

## 6️⃣ Key points

* You **don’t predict total delay** directly; you predict **how much more delay will accumulate**, which is easier for ML.
* The model naturally incorporates traffic patterns: e.g., even if the bus is only 2 km from the stop, it might accumulate **more delay during rush hour**.
* Features like **current speed, historical segment travel times, time of day** make predictions more accurate.

---

If you want, I can **sketch a Python pipeline** that:

1. Takes historical GPS + timetable
2. Computes `current_delay` and `additional_delay` for every GPS point
3. Prepares a dataset ready to train a regression model

This would be exactly what you need to predict **how much more delay a vehicle will accumulate before the stop**.

Do you want me to do that?
